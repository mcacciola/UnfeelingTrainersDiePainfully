Welcome to UTDP: Unfeeling Trainers Die Painfully!

Nurse Joy is fed up with having to constantly heal pokemon and has hired you to deploy 
several Pokemon throughout the neighborhood to ensure that no more uncaring trainers
are able to get licenses or harm anymore of the precious pokemon!

She gave you access to her secret stores of Pokemon to do this, including Charmander, Pichu,
Treeko, and Squirtle!  It costs money to deploy them, but once they are out there they can do
massive harm to those unsuspecting kids.  Each pokemon can also be evolved for an additional 
nominal fee.

Place pokemon on the map by left clicking their respective button and then left clicking the 
area of the screen where you want them to be deployed. You can't put Pokemon in houses or up 
trees, nor on the path the kids are traveling, because of magic.

If you want to evolve a pokemon, you can right-click it. You will automatically pay one and 
a half times its placement fee (rounded down, what a deal!) and the pokemon will evolve into
a more powerful form.  This frequently means greater range and damage for their attacks, and
for some Pokemon there are additional effects.

You can turn the sounds on or off at any time, simply by pressing S.
You can turn the music on or off at any time, simply by pressing M.

If too many kids get past you, Nurse Joy will be most unhappy and you are likely to pay for
your failure by being fed to her pet Mew!

Breakdown of Pokemon:

Squirtle/Blastoise - Fires a short-ranged, normal water attack.

Pichu/Pikachu - Fire a lightning bolt which travels further, but does less damage than
Squirtle's attack.

Charmander/Charizard - Has a fire attack which deals immediate damage as well as placing a
Damage Over Time burning affect on the targeted trainer.

Treeko/Grovyle - Fire a leaf-attack which does a small amount of damage, but causes nearby roots
to grab at the trainer's feet, effectively slowing him or her down.
